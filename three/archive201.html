			I designed a set of postcard as my response to a website.
      All content on my postcards are sourced from this particular blog named "All about the Chinese".
			I was shocked yet entertained by it as most of the blogposts seemed ridiculous to me.
			As much as I can see the blogger is trying to eliminate stereotypes, he/she clearly wasn't a 100% born and raised chinese. Not to say this blog stopped posting in 2012.<br>

			As I scrolled down to the bottom, a thought grew in my head: Is this how other people see me as a Chinese? What do people in the 2017 think of these outdated information? People might say "Hey! We have the right to speak whatever we want!" but do they really think about how a unresposible blogpost may end up with someone assuming your chinese friends suck at everything but playing piano? That they "drive like a Chinese person"?<br>

			So I designed and mailed these postcards to document other people's reponse.
